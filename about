 <h1>All about me</h1>
  <h2>(because everyone needed this right?) </h2>
  <p> Hi! My name is Behruze. I am a mediocre coder that does it as a hobby. Obviously I would like to learn more and become a professional. I hear some say that html isnt progamming or coding. To that I say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kL3HAbYkac">...</a><br/></p>
  <p>On a more serious note, my favorite things to do are game, code, and volunteer with pets. I really like to stay in and sleep, which is fortunately what I'm doing right now </p>
  <p>I have two cats, Cyprus and Gizmo</p>
  <p>I am 14 years old (I turn 15 in a month)</p>
  <p>My favorite books are the Percy Jackson series and all the spinoffs, this is when I didn't have anything else to do when I was young</p>
  <p>So thats my story, feel free to return to the other pages</p>
